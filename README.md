# Vanilla JS example for Speechmatics Flow API

**Note** This is an extremely bare-bones example to get an early look at what the API offers.

More complete examples featuring a feature rich SDK will be available soon.

### Start example

Start by  generating an API key in the Speechmatics portal: https://portal.speechmatics.com/api-keys.

In `index.js` assign

```javascript
const YOUR_API_KEY = // ^ api key generated above
```

In the root of the project run

```
npm run start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
